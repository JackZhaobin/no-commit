# NoCommit
A very simple distributed storage system based on Tokyo Cabinet

# Introduction #
 _NoCommit_ is a very simple distributed storage system based on Tokyo Cabinet, which may involve those technologies: Socket program, pthread, Makefile and engineering.
 This project is a college research project related to our course **Network Programing**, but it's structure is well designed by two Software Engineers.
# Planing #
 We are now planing to update it as an open source project. By now, we have 2 contributors, @yel\_hb and me.
 It is obviously that this is a project which is used to verify what we have learned in our courses. So, **don't care too much about this project**.
